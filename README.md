## 🏊 Welcome, desperate pooler...

Let me guess. You're tired.  
Your brain is mush.  
You typed `git clone` faster than your heart is beating.  
You thought: “This is it. The repo with **all the answers** to the Piscine exam.”  

LOL.

### 🫠 Reality check:

> **The Piscine is designed to make you suffer.**  
> There's no copy-paste salvation.  
> There's no cheat code.  
> There's only you... and your broken `malloc`.

## 📚 Piscine Tips That Actually Work

Instead of wasting your time here:
- Rewrite `write ` hhhhhh for the 100th time.
- Read the subject. Then read it again.
- Break your code. Fix it. Break it again.
- Sleep 4 hours. Survive on coffee and stress.
